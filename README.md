# Cruise-Controller
## Objective

To develop a cruise control for a car which needs to move at a fixed set-point velocity using a PID controller.

## Model

If the inertia of the wheels is neglected, and it is assumed that air drag (which is proportional to the carâ€™s speed at low speeds) is opposing the motion of the car, then the problem is reduced to a simple first-order system.

Thus the motion of the car can be written as, mv' + bv = u where u is the input force provided by the engine to move the car at a certain velocity. Though it
is intuitive to think of an input as something related to the gas pedal, but unfortunately to
represent such a system accurately the dynamics of it becomes really complicated for a task of a
beginner level. So for now we will just assume that our engine can give us a certain amount of
force without actually looking how that force translates to real life situations.

## Results
### Parameters
Mass - 1000 kg

Fixed velocity- 100 kmph

Drag coefficient - 1.2

### Velocity v/s Time Plot

## Conclusions
Rise time of system (time taken to reach 90% of target velocity) is 5 sec

Maximum overshoot is less than 2 %
